          This project started with one clear goal "to imporve quality of education people recieve
          across different educational institutions across Pakistan". The basis of a successful
          nation totaly depend on how are they educated. Taking this piont in mind Hire a Teacher
          offer a ranking base teacher job platform. Initaly Hire a Teacher works like other papular
          job platforms like Indeed, rozie.pk and etc. However we added a special feautre feedback
          to these processes and only dedciated it to teachers that make it a lot different and
          meanwhile useful. When teachers find a job through Hire a Teacher they get direct feedback
          from the student at the end of each course and study period. This way a teachers is rated
          based on their performance directly by their students. This will help both teachers and
          instituational organizations to focus on the quality of education.
